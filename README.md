A compile-time dependency injection library for kotlin.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class AppComponent {
    abstract val repo: Repository

    @Provides
    protected fun jsonParser(): JsonParser = JsonParser()

    protected val RealHttp.bind: Http
        @Provides get() = this
}

interface Http

@Inject
class RealHttp : Http

@Inject
class Api(private val http: Http, private val jsonParser: JsonParser)

@Inject
class Repository(private val api: Api)
```

```kotlin
val appComponent = AppComponent::class.create()
val repo = appComponent.repo
```

}
```

## Usage

Let's go through the above example line-by line and see what it's doing.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class AppComponent {
```

The building block of kotlin-inject is a component which you declare with an `@Component` annotation on an abstract
class. An implementation of this component will be generated for you.

```kotlin
    abstract val repo: Repository
```

In your component you can declare abstract read-only properties or functions to return an instance of a given type. This
is where the magic happens. kotlin-inject will figure out how to construct that type for you in it's generated
implementation. How does it know how to do this? There's a few ways:

```kotlin
@Provides
protected fun jsonParser(): JsonParser = JsonParser()
```

For external dependencies, you can declare a function or read-only property in the component to create an instance for a
certain type. kotlin-inject will use the return type to provide this instance where it is requested.

Note: It is good practice to always explicitly declare the return type, that way it's clear what type is being provided.
It may not always be what you expect!

```kotlin
protected val RealHttp.bind: Http
    @Provides get() = this
```

You can declare arguments to a providing function/property to help you construct your instance. Here we are taking in an
instance of `RealHttp` and providing it for the interface `Http`. You can see a little sugar with this as the receiver
type for an extension function/property counts as an argument. Another way to write this would be:

```kotlin
@Provides
fun http(http: RealHttp): Http = http
```

```kotlin
@Inject
class RealHttp : Http

@Inject
class Api(private val http: Http, private val jsonParser: JsonParser)

@Inject
class Repository(private val api: Api)
```

For your own dependencies you can simply annotate the class with `@Inject`. This will use the primary constructor to
create an instance, no other configuration required!

```kotlin
val appComponent = AppComponent::class.create()
val repo = appComponent.repo
```

Finally, you can create an instance of your component with the generated `.create()` extension function.

## Features

### Component Arguments

If you need to pass any instances into your component you can declare them as constructor args. You can then pass them
into the generated create function. You can optionally annotate it with `@Provides` to provide the value to the
dependency graph.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class MyComponent(@get:Provides protected val foo: Foo)
```

```kotlin
MyComponent::class.create(Foo())
```

If the argument is another component, you can annotate it with `@Component` and it's dependencies will also be available
to the child component. This allows you to compose them into a graph.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class ParentComponent {
    protected fun provideFoo(): Foo = ...
}

@Component
abstract class ChildComponent(@Component val parent: ParentComponent) {
    abstract val foo: Foo
}
```

```kotlin
val parent = ParentComponent::class.create()
val child = ChildComponent::class.create(parent)
```

### Type Alias Support

If you have multiple instances of the same type you want to differentiate, you can use type aliases. They will be
treated as separate types for the purposes of injection.

```kotlin
typealias Dep1 = Dep
typealias Dep2 = Dep

@Component
abstract class MyComponent {
    @Provides
    fun dep1(): Dep1 = Dep("one")

    @Provides
    fun dep2(): Dep2 = Dep("two")

    @Provides
    fun provides(dep1: Dep1, dep2: Dep2): Thing = Thing(dep1, dep2)
}

@Inject
class InjectedClass(dep1: Dep1, dep2: Dep2)
```

### Function Injection

You can also use type aliases to inject into top-level functions. Annotate your function with `@Inject` and create a
type alias with the same name.

```kotlin
typealias myFunction = () -> Unit

@Inject
fun myFunction(dep: Dep) {
}
```

You can then use the type alias anywhere and you will be provided with a function that calls the top-level one with the
requested dependencies.

```kotlin
@Inject
class MyClass(val myFunction: myFunction)

@Component
abstract class MyComponent {
    abstract val myFunction: myFunction
}
```

You can optionally pass explicit args as the last arguments of the function.

```kotlin
typealias myFunction = (String) -> String

@Inject
fun myFunction(dep: Dep, arg: String): String = ...
```

### Scopes

By default kotlin-inject will create a new instance of a dependency each place it's injected. If you want to re-use an
instance you can scope it to a component. The instance will live as long as that component does.

First create your scope annotation.

```kotlin
@Scope
@Target(CLASS, FUNCTION, PROPERTY_GETTER)
annotation class MyScope
```

Then annotate your component with that scope annotation.

```kotlin
@MyScope
@Component
abstract class MyComponent()
```

Finally, annotate your provides and `@Inject` classes with that scope.

```kotlin
@MyScope
@Component
abstract class MyComponent {
    @MyScope
    @Provides
    protected fun provideFoo(): Foo = ...
}

@MyScope
@Inject
class Bar()
```

### Component Inheritance

You can define `@Provides` and scope annotations on an interface or abstract class that's not annotated
with `@Component`. This allows you to have multiple implementations, which is useful for things like testing. For
example, you can have an abstract class like

```kotlin
@NetworkScope
abstract class NetworkComponent {
    @NetworkScope
    @Provides
    abstract fun api(): Api
}
```

Then you can have multiple implementations

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class RealNetworkComponent : NetworkComponent() {
    override fun api(): Api = RealApi()
}

@Component
abstract class TestNetworkComponent : NetworkComponent() {
    override fun api(): Api = FakeApi()
}
```

Then you can provide the abstract class to your app component

```kotlin
@Component abstract class AppComponent(@Component val network: NetworkComponent)
```

Then in your app you can do

```kotlin
AppComponent::class.create(RealNetworkComponent::class.create())
```

and in tests you can do

```kotlin
AppComponent::class.create(TestNetworkComponent::class.create())
```

### Multi-bindings

You can collect multiple bindings into a `Map` or `Set` by using the `@IntoMap` and `@IntoSet` annotations respectively.

For a set, return the type you want to put into a set, then you can inject or provide a `Set<MyType>`.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class MyComponent {
    abstract val allFoos: Set<Foo>

    @IntoSet
    @Provides
    protected fun provideFoo1(): Foo = Foo("1")

    @IntoSet
    @Provides
    protected fun provideFoo2(): Foo = Foo("2")
}
```

For a map, return a `Pair<Key, Value>`.

```kotlin
@Component
abstract class MyComponent {
    abstract val fooMap: Map<String, Foo>

    @IntoMap
    @Provides
    protected fun provideFoo1(): Pair<String, Foo> = "1" to Foo("1")

    @IntoMap
    @Provides
    protected fun provideFoo2(): Pair<String, Foo> = "2" to Foo("2")
}
```

### Function Support & Assisted Injection

Sometimes you want to delay the creation of a dependency or provide additional params manually. You can do this by
injecting a function that returns the dependency instead of the dependency directly.

The simplest case is you take no args, this gives you a function that can create the dep.

```kotlin
@Inject
class Foo

@Inject
class MyClass(fooCreator: () -> Foo) {
    init {
        val foo = fooCreator()
    }
}
```

If you define args, you can use these to assist the creation of the dependency. To do so, mark these args with the
`@Assisted` annotation. The function should take the same number of assisted args in the same order.

```kotlin
@Inject
class Foo(bar: Bar, @Assisted arg1: String, @Assisted arg2: String)

@Inject
class MyClass(fooCreator: (arg1: String, arg2: String) -> Foo) {
    init {
        val foo = fooCreator("1", "2")
    }
}
```

### Lazy

Similarly, you can inject a `Lazy<MyType>` to construct and re-use an instance lazily.

```kotlin
@Inject
class Foo

@Inject
class MyClass(lazyFoo: Lazy<Foo>) {
    val foo by lazyFoo
}
```

### Default Arguments

You can use default arguments for parameters you inject. If the type is present in the graph, it'll be injected,
otherwise the default will be used.

  ```kotlin
@Inject class MyClass(val dep: Dep = Dep("default"))

@Component abstract class ComponentWithDep {
    abstract val myClass: MyClass
    @Provides fun dep(): Dep = Dep("injected")
}
@Component abstract class ComponentWithoutDep {
    abstract val myClass: MyClass
}

ComponentWithDep::class.create().myClass.dep // Dep("injected")
ComponentWithoutDep::class.create().myClass.dep // Dep("default")
```

### Options

You can provide some additional options to the processor.

- `me.tatarka.inject.enableJavaxAnnotations=true`

  `@javax.inject.*` annotations can be used in in addition to the provided annotations. This can be useful if you are
  migrating existing code or want to be abstracted from the injection lib you are using on the jvm.

- `me.tatarka.inject.generateCompanionExtensions=true`

  This will generate the `create()` methods on the companion object instead of the component's class. This allows you to
  do
  `MyComponent.create()` instead of `MyComponent::class.create()`. However, due to a kotlin limitation you will have to
  explicitly specify a companion object for your component.

  ```kotlin
  @Component abstract class MyComponent {
    companion object
  }
  ```

- `me.tatarka.inject.dumpGraph=true`

  This will print out the dependency graph when building. This can be useful to help debug issues.
